Program that takes in an image of a person (jpeg, jpg, png) and analyzes it and then gives info on demographic as well as the representation of said demographic in the electoral college.

Run server.py and it'll give you a local hosted address.

I only did the server side, the actual algorithm detecting thing was done by https://github.com/arefmalek
